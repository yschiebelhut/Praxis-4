Large scale cloud service offerings are an important part of modern enterprise infrastructure.
The deployment of these is traditionally done by hand, requiring days of work and therefore also being costly.
The supervising department works on automizing this deployment process and related maintenance tasks with the aim to provide the interaction functionality as a self-contained \ac{cli}.

Still, the tools that are used to perform the automated deployment are not able to run without some perquisites being fulfilled.
In this project, the existing bootstrapping procedure is analyzed, redesigned and implemented to be integrated into the developed \ac{cli}.
Different approaches for interacting with involved services are introduced and compared.
Then, a prototype of the bootstrap is implemented in Go.
