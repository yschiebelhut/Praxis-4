In order to raise cross company processes to a new level SAP is working on the development of \acl*{ccwf}.
The shared process data is to be imported into \emph{Signavio Process Intelligence} to be analyzed with process mining and to be presented in \aclp*{kpi}.
Since \acl*{ccwf} uses the \emph{SAP Blockchain} to store data the preparation of the data for analysis within Signavio is a challenge.

In the context of this report, these difficulties will first be discussed.
It then deals with the conceptual design of a data integration process.
For this purpose, on the one hand, it is discussed where the conversion of the data from \acl*{ccwf} into the target format should be carried out.
On the other hand, different transport routes are discussed, through which the processed data should be made available in Signavio Process Intelligence.
Based on the developed concept, a prototype of the data integration is implemented.
